## overview
This project to analyze customer membership, their behavior, trend and gym service performance (Personal Trainee,  Group Lesson) for the gym business to managing and
upgrade their service for better future

## About project
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project demonstrates my ability to work with SQL queries.
In this project I fully use PostgreSQL to process data and analyze gym membership data to answer Data Exploration - Key Questions.
I will analyze to find out the value and things that can be known about the Trend & Behavior of gym members 
for the development of the gym's business in managing their membership.
